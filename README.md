# History in our world
1. The armed confrontation between government forces and pro-ISIS militants in Marawi has forcibly displaced 98 percent of the total population of the city, as well as residents from nearby municipalities, who were compelled to leave due to severe food shortage and/or constriction of local economies.
2. Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as "Yolanda", struck the Philippines on November 8, 2013, in what was reportedly the country's worst-ever natural disaster. More than 8,000 people lost their lives and over 14 million inhabitants, including 5.9 million workers, were affected in some way by the storm.
## Martial Law
1. Martial law is the replacement of civilian government by military rule and the suspension of civilian legal processes for military powers. Martial law can continue for a specified amount of time, or indefinitely, and standard civil liberties may be suspended for as long as martial law continues.
